      <p>Roorkee is a historically significant city located in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, nestled in the
        fertile plains near the Himalayan foothills. Established during the British colonial period, the city has
        transformed from a small settlement to an important educational and engineering hub of national importance.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>The city's most prominent institution, the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee (IIT Roorkee), stands as a
        testament to India's technological prowess. Founded in 1847 as the Roorkee College of Engineering, it is one of
        the oldest technical institutions in Asia, predating India's independence and serving as a crucial center for
        engineering education and research.
      </p>

        alt="Ganga Canal, Roorkee" class="image-left" />
      <p>Roorkee's engineering legacy extends beyond academic institutions. The Ganga Canal, an extraordinary hydraulic
        engineering project completed during British rule, dramatically transformed agricultural practices in North
        India. This remarkable infrastructure project showcases the city's historical significance in water management
        and irrigation technology.</p>

      <p>Geographically, Roorkee serves as a strategic gateway to some of Uttarakhand's most revered destinations. Its
        proximity to Haridwar and Rishikesh makes it an ideal base for spiritual seekers, pilgrims, and tourists
        interested in exploring the rich cultural and natural landscapes of the Himalayan region.</p>
